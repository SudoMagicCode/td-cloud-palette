# Cloud Palette

## Summary
Cloud Palette presents a collection of components and examples that you can pull to integrate into your project without needing to host them locally. The view of available components here is a representation of assets that are available from the cloud. Rather than storing elements locally on your machine, Cloud Palette's idea is that you want the ease of use to pull components from the cloud. No component represented in the tree view of Cloud Palette is local, instead, pulling a comp loads it dynamically from the web - making this ideal for quickly loading elements from the web without needing a complete store locally.

## TDM Installation
If you are using the [TouchDesigner Dependency Manager](https://github.com/SudoMagicCode/TouchDesigner-Dependency-Manager) you can add this component to your local project with a `add package` command.
